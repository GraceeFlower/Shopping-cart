# Shopping-cart
This is a simple shopping cart about stationaries.  
It contains five functions:  

- select product
- add the count
- reduce the count
- delete the product item
- calculate the subtotal & total

The JSON is static, and I append the nodes according to it.  
When you reduce the count of some product to zero, you will delete the product item.  
The Choose-All button helps you to selects all the products in the cart, try it!
